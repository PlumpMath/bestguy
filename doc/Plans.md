# Roadmap

* Start with a first run sample version of making a cube and rendering it to some sort of model file. (that can be viewed in some sort of viewer)
* Play around with different ways to combine cubes. Play around with various possible apis.
* Work on primitives for backend exporters. Ideally build on protocolls so different formats are possible for models.
* Experiment with other ways to combine shapes.
* Start playing with complex relationships. A door goes "on" a wall, but will usually not be touching one of the sides and will be touching the bottom. etc...
* Functions for *solving* a group of relationships between shapes for possible objects. Want to be able to generate lots of different kinds of houses from saying. (4 walls, a door, a roof, some windows)
* Different ways to specify distributions of the relationship. Branches can come out of any part of the trunk, but they're more likely to be towards the top and spread out from other branches.
* Animation and movement. Specify creatures that can walk (and possibly their behaviors) in the same manner.
* web based "3d graphics repl"
* Other backends that are useful. Unity3D, openGL. And more importantly make it easy for others to add backends they care about.

# bestguy

Library for declaritive creation of 3d models (and creatures!)

Also includes example app which is a cljs/clj web app that you can use to play around with the library.

Example app is a clojurescript web editor where you can see and play with the actual bestguy examples. Building that first so I can use it as I build the actual library.

libraries to use for it

* codemirror
* nrepl-cljs-middleware
* clojail
